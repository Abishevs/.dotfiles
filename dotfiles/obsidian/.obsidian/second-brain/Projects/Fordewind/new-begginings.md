## B2B business model
So the website gotta be an B2B focused on showing what we have done, how we are accoploshing that.
To mainly encourge new people to work for us, I think internships or sommar jobs would be also a pretty good investment
in to the company as it would show that we do care. But mainly we need new installatörer.

## Rough plan
1. First make an django + wagtail fordewind.se website. Learn all the basics of django, deploy it and imlement devOps and CI/CD.
2. Then make an shop.fordewind.se (or think of a better naming) for sea sea and other vendors reselling boat parts. With Django-oscar.
3. Then make an CRM/ email marketing tool for fordewind.
4. Add analytics for both websites and improve them based on statistics.
