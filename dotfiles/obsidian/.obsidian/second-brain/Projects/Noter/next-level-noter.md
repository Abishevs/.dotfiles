# Next level Noter

## Problem
* I like nvim, and taking notes there
* It's not that simple to have my notes on my phone
* I love Obisidian graph view and backlinks etc
* I love idea of wiki notes and its back links and daily notes (CLI version)
* Fast todos via todoist(sucha simple interface i love it)
* version control? If notes are longer and changes over time- like writing blog posts etc.

## Technical problem TODO:
* Nvim plugin for fetching todays todos inside neovim and thus saving those inside the files
* Web interface too see all my notes pretty (or desktop app, both work)
* Easily navigatable CLI version of my notes app aka noter
* Adding todos from withing todoist fetching them inside nvim and markdown, + adding new todos from within nvim.
* Backlinks and linking and graph view just like in obisidian.
* Statistics of my habitial note taking to analys and improve my writing habits.
* CLI tool for creating new notes and or within nvim itself.
* AWS s3 bucket as storage? fetching and syncing all notes via the CLI version. Async via the web
* If for non-techinal users, then desktop and or webapp would have editing, template creating features.
