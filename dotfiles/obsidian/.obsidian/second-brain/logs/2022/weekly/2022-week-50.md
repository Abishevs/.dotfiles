 ## Reflection over the week 
Wrote Math NP [[2022-12-12]]. Went terribly bad, most likely an D max...Had focus on diffrent things like programming.
Tho presented Programming project in English. NOT THE GRADE i was hoping for (e,e,c)...but ou well had to invest more time into it...My fault.
On the other hand Prog. expt. went good. Our game is indeed very good, no bugs etc. But quite tidious to play if you aint an reader.
Made some expetional progress on my note taking system. Love it so far. Made an Bash script for easy access to notes.
 ## Plans for next week
