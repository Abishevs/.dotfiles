## Nightlyy thoughts 
My vim skills and motivation grows, its an intresting expierience. Feels less work in the long run, but rn its amazingly slow, I gotta think
about everysingle command that i write and how i should write...
* Instalee LunarVim, havent created an config file tho.
* did some math, but it felt realy hard...and have no idea why i stoped
## Tomorow list of things
I gotta do more math... I do have an NP on Monday...
Learn Vim by using it for my notes (I believe the most editing is done there)
Try vim in the projects aswell. Edit in VIM the more you will do it the better u will get + u will be good in markdown
and lastly in typing per cay.
