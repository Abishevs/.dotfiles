## Morning thoughts
Yesterday i fixed and made WSL ubuntu work, now i have a good dev envierament on windows ;)
Vim is only as good as it pilot.
But mega fun to use on a laptop as i hate using trackpad(and mouse aswell, LOL)Â¨

Getting used to this kind of workflow, writing markdown files is kinda fun and
like anti-stressfull. Makes me calm
Got google drive working on WSL! Nice, well then all my notes will be on google driver i guess. Will use my VPS 
for better purposes. And Obsidian only on desktops as ios sucks :)
