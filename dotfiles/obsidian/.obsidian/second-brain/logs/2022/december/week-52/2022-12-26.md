[[noter]] starts to take a bit more time than it should. Came up with an idea to use my own gitserver... so took some time to assamle all together. Can use obsidian on mobile tho, so thats a great thing.

Well that means that i gotta come up with a better solution for commiting and pull/pushinf  files as rn its like couple of commands. If forgotten, then i would need to do merging, which is indeed also a better salution rather than just sync(that would make newer changes overwrite older ones)
