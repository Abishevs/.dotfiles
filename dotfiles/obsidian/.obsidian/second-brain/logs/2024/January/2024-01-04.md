 ## Night Thoughts 
 ARCH, install went smooth. I installed windows 10 in like an hour or 2
 (installed some games so that when I will be playing I can just boot
 into win). Installed arch on the first try to reinstalling nothing :)
 Tho I did it simply, everthing on the nvme drive, have not yet formated
 SSD drive so old win 10 and Ubuntu is still there kek.

 AUR and Pacman is amazing when you get used to it you can download any
 software in seconds hehe. i3 install did asked for some extra love, I
 tried LightDm but ditched it as theming is usualy done with js or ts
 and if something breaks, well you have yourself an fucking blackscreen
 good luck with that, spent like 30 min to get it back to working. Since
 then I simply destroyed LigthDm so simple login from tty and bash
 script to startx. Easy peasy. Installed almost all the software I need 
 configured it all.

 What I need to do is fix vim as it's about to break, gotta switch to
 using lazy nvim as packer is dying. Aswell lsp has some sort of
 deprected function.

 Installed newsboat and stuff, gonna check out more RSS feeds and
 seriosly gotta stop looking at YT videos this much am not a kid anymore
 I can build and do cool stuff my self now xd...
