## Year 2022...
Was quite challenging but am still the same old person who just wants to learn so much
at the same time. I switch betweeen subjects and fields of study daily/weekly/monthly...
Which made me dig into Web dev, OOP with python in school and sys admin stuff
Started using ubuntu desktop more seriosly which is great. Started hosting my own things
like git server for my notes. Syncing it with iPhone which was blody hard to get an working 
solution for my Obsidian needs as Obsidian is limited with syncing.

Was quite motivated for Gym at the begginning of the year and in the middle of it...Of
course at the end it felt like there was no time for Gym...

I still haven't figure out how to balance my life and not have the feeling that I have to do 
right now, which annoys me af.

I trully believe that notes is the key of making my life more productive and meaning full
as I will be able to reflect on my thoughts thus show my self that I indeed did a lot 

And of course to make a second brain as my brain generates great ideas and I do keep
them in my head all the time which is CPU intensive task I that's where [[noter]] comes in :)

The more I write the more I will be able to produce, productivly, atleast that's the idea
worked out great in 2020-2021 when I did my notes had the best routines and good habits
such as: reading regullary, journaling almost everyday, studying at home, was proactive at
school. And most importantlyy when i re read my older notes I get inspired and i see 
that i can doo more that am capable of great things :)
