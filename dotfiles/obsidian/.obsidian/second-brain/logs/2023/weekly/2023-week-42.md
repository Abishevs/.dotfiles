 ## Reflection over the week 

This week was full of emotions and new things.
Firtstly I finnly got a better grip on how I should study physics and chemestry. Gotta just dig
deeper the same as I do with programming that way I have an feeling that I want to know more!

Secondly I fell in love with rust. The way I need to define types and do error handling 
resonates with my way of working in python, tho sometimes I don't want to. I just want
something that kinda works, but well then rust is not the right tool. then just go with
Python. As you can't realy take shortcuts in Rust, you gotta define everything and be 
plicit, don't take me wrong I absolutily love this way of working, that way I can find bugs early
and rustc will not let me make dumb decisions, if you are okay with dumb decisions=>> go with python
mate.

Thirdly gymnasi arbete goes quite good with an new additions of Rust for simulations, it's way faster 
and a bit more easier to handle then. In Rust I will focus on simulation part and in Python on the analys part
clear seperation of concerns and I will not try match things between em too. So python package will be just for 
statictal analys of this specific scenario. So I should name it accordinly, as staticial tests for poker shuffle
evaluations. rather than generic stats, as I haven't realy made it in a way that it could be used for anything else.

 ## Plans for next week 
 *  Get ready for wendsdays test in kemi
 *  Get a hang of SHM and start delving into Matematiskt pendeln [fysik]
