While in high school(last year as u may know) i was awlays dreaming about becoming an mehanical engineer. As i love to build stuff, CAD modeling and been facinated about manufacturing. But latly iâ€™ve been so drawn into programming, computer systems, server configurations, terminal use and commands( terminal an commands are also quit near my heart, as when i was playing csgo, i used console for changing everything in game state and i loved it!) But now i have a year to choose an university program: my first thought was of course mehanical engineer(any thing else didnt made much sense) but latly I see my self that i do not have the same passion for physics or math as i do for programming- mby its procrastination- as i feel that i do a lot in the computer space. Or mby bc physics and maths are realy hard to grasp fully. So am now kinda confused what i want to do. I really love mehanical engineering and the courses there, even tho i know they will be hella hard. But from other side I love programming and computer science and robotics etc. what are your thoughts, could u help me make sense of my thoughts and frustrations??
