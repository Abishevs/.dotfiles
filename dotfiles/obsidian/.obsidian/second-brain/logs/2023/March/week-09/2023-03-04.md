 ## Night Thoughts 
 It's time to take scheduling more serious and actualy stick with the plan and not do some stupid ass stuff!  
 
 Am trying to learn to much at once with no real plan, and it does me realy nothing.
 Gotta stick with the note taking plan. If I learn smth new write a note about it in the specific subfolder in cheatsheet!
 Otherwise there is realy no point of learning so much. When it's time to learn AWS and deployment.
 Then do it and write cheatsheet for it! When it's time for GitHub Actions then write a cheatsheet!
 Same for everything I do. Then it will be possible to have some blog posts for my own website.
 Whenever I make it (it's on the last priority rn) Before that comes noter and CLI for better
 organisation of notes and easy of use. Let's simply work smart rather than hard with no social life whatsoever... GN
