 ## Morning Thoughts 
O nice created at 13:37. That's cool...I have couple od days left till f√∂rdjupningsdag...and I haven't even touched swedish
nor fyisks...Why? I still can't figure out why am not doing it...I guess I don't get the joy, but that is bullshit, I love
to be the smartest I love to be the one working the hardest etc, and am but in diffrent fields...I will burn out if i dont 
start leverging my notes and the power of planning...Ditch everyhting else, do what you gotta do...
I should start my day with daily note! That's the whole point of this...
And I have to make my yearly note at some point in the near future, the faster you start the better!
 ## Tasks
