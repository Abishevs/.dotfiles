 ## Morning Thoughts 
Matte prov AO2, wuhuu. Fan va snabbt det går. Men jag är redo, har inte gjort min 100% dvs 
kan inte blama nån annan om jag får en jävla d eller c igen nu.

What now? I do already have a plan for fordewind so essentialy it's  just to start writing
wireframes and designs to then build them in Tailwind, but the question is obvios is that
even a good blody idea? As it will take a lot of time to debbug if something happens
and i will need setup CI/CD piplines in github actions and aws for this to even be effective
otherwise it will be prone to failure. But essentialy at it's core it will be a simple website
atleast for now on. but much more flexible to expand and add new things.

Main goal is to learn for me, this is my chance to learn python deeper with django and wagtail
and web dev in it's core, front end tech with html and css(tailwind) so it will be fun but most
likely painfull journy... Wordpress is always blody easier but it's outdated and bloated
and u need to pay for all those plugins for it to even work as i want.

IN django i can do anything i want, but it will take coding to make it happen. Like do i need
linkeding post feed on the website? Well learn linkedins API and start rolling...

Need to add new blog? Well just create a new page with streamblock fields and create as u want
come up with a design for pictures, headings text etc. Profile of who made it make it as u wish
Why? CUZ I FUCKING CAN and I FUCKING WANT. No other driver than that. it's just i want to learn
all that. 

I need to start planing Noter as rn my workflow is so fucking iretating that I hate it. 
LIke diary writing, tech notes, cheat sheets. I do learn a lot but I haven't realy writen
anything in the cheat-sheet. Which is kind of sad lol. 
 ## Tasks 

 - [ ] Wireframe or redisgn existing home page, keep it simple for starters, I need to move forward! 
 - [ ] If design is ready well then try writing the logic in wagtail, i need practice!
 - [ ] Play Fifa if mf gonna play, atleast for a little bit!
