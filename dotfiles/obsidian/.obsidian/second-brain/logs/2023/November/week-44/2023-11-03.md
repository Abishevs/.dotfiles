 Idk Watching suits bofore my biggest grind and learning year. Even if I told my self i will not watch series
 or procrastinate i still did watch series, limited couple of series max! But for the last couple of days I've been
 watching it over again. There is something about grinding and getting the life you want, but it's more. Serie is about
 personal bonds, friendships and family! And that's what I've been missing since a long time ago. I never had good family bonds
 even tho my family is full and we have everything we are not realy family in a way we are seperated, we are in groups.
 Each one has a good bond with each other, but we rarly want to do something together and when we do it's just weird fights for no 
 resoun. But the problem is that we are all independent, we never work as an team as an family. We all do what we want to
 not what should do. That's why dad gets angry as he wants everything in order but he hates that he can't be in control
 neither of us would listen as we all think that we know best...Is there anything we could do? As a smart woman said in Swiss
 That I already know the solution I just don't want to admit it neither I want to grow up, and it's true who would want that?
 Doing all by himself, it's easier to live when you think your biggest problem in life is if you had done your homework...I love
 the feeling of doing, but latly am getten anxious. It happend when it hit me that I might not get into KTH after all this "work".
 I've kinda working, I had done alot but not in the right field- programming, pc etc all the comfy stuff. So now it's time to 
 grind school, get the theoritcal knowledge as that's where am lacking.

 I know why i love suits so much it's about friendship and profeseninal attiude smart words and the lifestyle of theirs. I learn, i get inspired
but the thing is I want that life and those friendships that's why I love it so much. And the resoun i hand't watch for so long
is that I couldn't. I love the idea of smart words and corparate words, am like between worlds. thats my strenght I can understand
both parties- tehnical and smart ass corporate. Yes am teribale at talking right now, but that will change over the years. I will become 
the very very best self of me! :))
