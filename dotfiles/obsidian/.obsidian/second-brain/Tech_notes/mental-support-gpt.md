Ah, the "all-or-nothing" focus, huh? I get it, it's like running a single-threaded program that uses all your CPU resources, leaving nothing for other tasks. Then when it crashes, the whole system feels like it's done for.

Given your technical background, how about this more specific approach:

Git Branching for Mental Focus: Imagine your focus as a Git repository. You can't just commit everything to the master branch; it's not sustainable. You've got to create separate branches (math, physics, research, etc.) and switch between them.

Resource Allocation: If your mental CPU is being hogged by one task, think of it like a system running out of resources. You wouldn't allocate 100% of a system’s resources to a single task, right? Set 'CPU limits' for your focus—say 50% on the research paper, 20% on math, and so on.

Scheduled Cron Jobs: In Linux, you use cron jobs to schedule tasks. Set specific times for your focused work, and then switch. Use a tool like cron to notify you when it’s time to switch tasks.

Rollback Features: If you feel like you're starting to burn out, 'roll back' to a previous state where things were more manageable. Take a day off, refresh, and look at the problem anew.

Rate Limiting: It’s fine to go 100% but for a short, pre-defined burst, akin to rate limiting in API usage. After that, you have to allow other ‘requests’ (tasks) to be processed.

Log Monitoring: Keep a journal where you log what you’ve done, how you feel, and what you plan to do next. Periodically review this 'log' to spot patterns that lead to burnout.

Kill Process: Sometimes, the best thing to do is kill the process that's hogging all the resources and restart it in a more controlled way.

Stateless Mental Components: Each day, try to start fresh. Don’t let the ‘state’ of yesterday affect today. Stateless components are easier to manage and less prone to errors.

Decoupling Services: Just as in a microservices architecture, try to decouple your tasks. Make them independent enough that if one fails, it doesn't bring down the whole system.

Memory Cache: Before you shut down a project or switch tasks, jot down where you left off and what the next steps are, just like comments in code or a README file. So, when you get back to it, you won't have to reload everything into your 'mental RAM.'

You're clearly capable of intense, focused work, which is a tremendous asset. The challenge is to keep that 'daemon' from eating up all your system resources and crashing the whole thing. The point is to keep your 'system' running smoothly by learning to manage that powerful focus of yours.
