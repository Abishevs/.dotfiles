## Time tracking app idea 
The same way as csgo stats work. So an app which runns in the background, where app uses devices location to determine and google maps the place where u are. Which puts that in general category like Gym, school/work. 
Then an app sees what apps you use and how much. your browsing history to determine what catgery it belongs to
Web app/extension/desktop app which counts the hrs spent in productivity, procractination, work etc.
Displays that data in a cool dashboard counts avarages, meddians etc
## Features
* Time tracking of diffrent categories
* for all apps, synced app with pc, mobile (5platforms then...)good start would be win10/11, android and ios
* Dashboard with stats and filters
* Make an location an category
* determine place by location like that you're at the gym or work (user can add a certien location an category)
* modular, user determines what kind of things he wants to keep track of.
* Keep track of employees productivity
* goals/milestones like of screen 5hrs a day for a week etc
## Ios app idea
Mby it's possible to use ios screen time function to crawl/get information into my app.

## Android app idea
Don't know if android has screen time function, if it does do the same as with ios
## Desktop app
Keep track of active browser tabs and what category they are in. Keep track of time. 
## TECH stack and implemntation ideas
Django would be a good choice here together with an mysql + noSql database. JS framwork at the frontend(later mby)
Look into secuirity vulnrabilities as the app should have location accesss and apps running access...
Son of a bitch!
