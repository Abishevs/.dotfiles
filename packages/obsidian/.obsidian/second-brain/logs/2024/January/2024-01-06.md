 ## Morning Thoughts 
Fucking hell, switching to lazy.nvim wasn't easy at all...

 ## Tasks 
 - [ ] hmm

 ## Reflection 

 ## Plan for tomorrow 
 * I realy dunno? Fix nvim bugs with some plugins?
 * Prepare school pc. 

 ## Night Thoughts 
But at the end I did it. Still not good enough not everything works and
all. But I made YT rss feed with an custom py script to scrape channel
id and name to pass to newsboat urls list. Added config from LukeSmith
rn just an copy pasta as I needed keybindings didn't know how to. Also
coloring of feeds. Added nerd font now it looks sleeeek. Haven't done
anything nearly productive but I feel like I realy needed this as am
enjoying my env even more with suckless software with Arch with
Librewolf and it Vimium addon (The best addon only because of that I
it's okay to switch to fireeefox). Tomorow I gotta finnish my initial DE
save what needs to be saved and add it my school pc fix all small bugs
and so that my schoool env works with no major problems! 
 
Btw this font is nice I realy like f's and y's an capital Q's
Arch does need much more love this week I could have worked on
ErgoGeekBoard or any school subject for that matter...

But on positives I found Ready Player One as a book am reading it rn
before sleep. Quite good very close to the movie actualy atleast the
beggining.
