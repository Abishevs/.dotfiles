 ## Morning Thoughts 
 Hmm obisidan.nvim is intresting, but i will need to spend some extra
 time for this so that it works excatly as i want. Requires extra
 configurations to setup daily notes and others, like my tech notes for
 example and other folders within notes? otherwise i will need to revise
 notes as an second step at some point of time. Cuz otherwise they all
 will be placed in the root of my vault and that's not so good in terms
 sturcture.

 ## Tasks 
 - [ ] Start ErgoGeekBoard project, setup issues and base structure
 - [ ] 

 ## Reflection 
Nvim plugin is good, but not good enough. Am missing catgerisation into
folders for month and year!

 ## Plan for tomorrow 
 *  Start physic prov prep! Check what needs to be done, setup schema
    and start working
 *  Math- do some integrals and derivates, check nokflex on what you
    haven't finnished and start with that!
 *  Start new issue in ErgoGeekBoard project.
 * Save SSH keys (prep for deleting ubuntu and installing arch)

 ## Night Thoughts 
 Github issues, PRs and project kanbana are amazing tools. Am gonna use
 them for all my projects now! Together with The Elsenhower method is
 amazing and effective. Am gonna use The Elsenhower method everywhere as
 it realy makes you think on whats important and what needs to be done
 rn and what can wait for later!

 Obsidian.nvim was excatly what I needed now am back at creating notes.
 It's because nvim plugin makes it easy, haven't yet added keybindings
 but that will come later I just don't now which I need and how I want
 them. Gotta use the tool first.
