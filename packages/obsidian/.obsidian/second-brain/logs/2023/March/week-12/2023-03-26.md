 ## Morning Thoughts 
If I want to persue Engineering in Mehanical + robotics or even aerospace I most definetly 
need a great understanding of Math and Physics not just foundational but deep understanding.
Those two subject + programming will teach me analytical and complex problem solving skills.
I know Math and especialy physic concepts can be hard to grasp and do tend to give up pretty
easily.
