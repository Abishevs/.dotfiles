 ## Morning Thoughts 
Note taking haven't been any good latly, i did make some great progress latly. But still 
I've made this note taking system for my own benefit, to be have fun taking notes again.
Cuz i wanted to learn to type correctly and fast on pc, and in the meanwhile get some value out of 
doing that.

 ## Reflection 
I know excatly why I cant focus...The root cause is simple. 
THATS WHY I gotta use these daily notes and notes overall.
That's a way for my brain to get off Thoughts that just trash my brain,
There is so much trash in my brain.
