## Morning Thoughts
* Woke up late, mad and kinda sick. Missed school
* COFFEEEE

## Todays tasks:
- []  Math prep
- [x]  Make the room


## Reflection
* Learned that Vim is actualy fun af!
* Made synced connections with my own nextcloud(backup_vps) and my local obsidian.  
* Rethought my note taking process. Hopefully Vim + Obsidian will motivate me and make note taking fun, productive and beneficial process! 
* While conecting Nextcloud client on ubuntu got a problem that my reverse_proxy was not routing properly. So SSH'ed into my instance and fixed it (in 2hrs ;))
* added a robust file system to my Obsidian vault.
## Night thoughts
If I will have to rethink, then I actualy did a lot today! Not what was of the highest priority, but hopefully this change will benefit me in the future! And lastly VIM IS FUN, hard but fun! Rn been using just the same as nano, but even so it's already better and kinda more convient when editing. Like insert mode, normal mode does make a lot of sense!

## Tomorows plan
1. Math prep!
* Do AO2 (derivator) for 2hrs then a pause, then for 2hrs AO3 (integraler+ derivator) Reference from classroom. 
2. Daily notes template for Obsidian! + hotkeys (F3 or smth) 
3. Take a look at projekt-ass-boobs. Added last Dict texts, it gotta be clean for wedndays expot!!! no bugs!
