Here will be more info about noter and mby more source code docs
What problems do i have now? Noter is more for structured notes, like blog posts
And good notes will be for more messy notes like maths and physics. Personal dailies 
While obsidian and noter would be like my second brain where i would have all the "docks" of 
my tech life. Like Help guides instructions blog posts and other stuff that i know I just have too keep 
in a structred manner that I can iteraate over, so on phone and everywhere accessable.
Thus I would need to build an betteer cli toool that I could integrate into my tmux workflow, switch to docs fast. 
Find what am looking for fast, so basicily use linux built in tools for that. Why inventit from sratch.
So basicly- tech notes, cheat sheeets, guidlines and docs for projects that I do like server configuartions, common problems
in linux word aka linux 101. So that I can also first search my notes before I dive into world wide web. Ahh AI help would be nice here.
an personal AI that knows what I know, would be cool and handy af.
